## Installation

prober is installed via CloudFormation, which also provides a quick link. Prober is set up with 2-3 minutes, after that a CloudWatch dashboard shows the status of the AWS account.

## How does it work?

prober is not yet another SaaS tool, but is installed directly into your AWS account, so you have complete control and visibilty.

prober utilizes the following AWS services and features:

 - AWS Config Rules for checks and evaluation
 - CloudWatch Dashboard as UI to display the checks and help
 - CloudFormation for installation and updates
